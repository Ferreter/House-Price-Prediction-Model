This project aims to produce a composite index of house price data to explore housing affordability, with a special focus on whether students will be able to afford a house in the coming years in Ireland. The topic was chosen due to the persistent housing affordability crisis in Ireland, which has significant effects on individuals and society.

### Context and Justification<a name="context-and-justification"></a>

Against the backdrop of broader economic challenges, the housing market in Ireland has experienced consistent price increases in recent years, reaching record highs. The average monthly rent for a home in Dublin approaches â‚¬2,000, while house and apartment prices continue to rise across the country. This situation reflects systemic challenges exacerbated by high demand, limited supply, and significant investment activity, particularly affecting younger generations (source: TheJournal.ie, Housing Ireland Magazine).

While government initiatives like affordable housing schemes have been introduced, key problems related to supply and cost remain largely unresolved. The crisis of affordability extends beyond Ireland and is part of a wider European context where similar dynamics occur.

### Methodology<a name="methodology"></a>

The project will involve multivariate analysis to identify key factors affecting house prices, including determinants such as location and size concerning amenities. Techniques like regression analysis will be used to understand how different variables affect prices. This will lead to weighting and normalizing these factors to create a robust index that can serve as a prediction tool for future affordability.

### Significance of the Study<a name="significance-of-the-study"></a>

This project addresses the real-life problem of home accessibility for Ireland's young generation. Its objective is to provide clearer future market directions to potential homeowners and policymakers by reviewing up-to-date data and trends. The framework operationalizes a structured approach to effectively respond to a critical issue using available data for insight generation, embodying practical application of analysis and visualization techniques learned in the course.

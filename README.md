### Initial Summary<a name="initial-summary"></a>
This project aims to produce a composite index of house price data to explore housing affordability, with a special focus on whether students will be able to afford a house The topic was chosen due to the persistent housing affordability crisis in Ireland, which has significant effects on individuals and society.

### Data Cleaning<a name="data-cleaning"></a>



The data cleaning process was meticulously documented to evaluate the impact of different cleaning techniques on the size of a dataset, which initially contained 4600 entries. Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the findings:

- **Uncleaned Data:** Initially, the dataset had 4600 entries, which served as our baseline for comparison.
  
- **Drop Missing Values:** By removing rows with any missing values, the dataset retained 4600 entries, indicating there were no missing values to begin with. This approach would typically reduce dataset size if missing values were present.

- **Fill Missing Values with Mean:** Filling missing values with the mean of their respective columns also resulted in 4600 entries, maintaining the original dataset size. This method ensures that the statistical integrity of numerical features is preserved without reducing the data quantity.

- **Fill and Cleaned:** The most intensive cleaning involved not only filling missing values but also removing duplicates and outliers based on the 'price' column. This step reduced the dataset to 4360 entries, a decrease of about 5.2%. This approach potentially improves model performance by focusing on more typical, representative data points.

#### Key Observations:
- The dataset initially did not have any missing values as indicated by the unchanged count after dropping missing data.
- The substantial cleanup (removing duplicates and outliers) resulted in a moderate reduction in dataset size. This suggests the presence of duplicate records and price values that are extreme outliers, which were effectively trimmed to ensure a more normalized dataset for further analysis.

#### Implications:
- **Data Integrity:** Filling missing values (if any were to exist) with the mean is a strategic choice for maintaining the maximum amount of data, crucial for large datasets or when data acquisition is costly or challenging.
- **Quality vs. Quantity:** Removing duplicates and outliers might reduce the dataset size, but it significantly enhances the quality of the data, which can lead to more accurate and reliable predictive models.



#### Analysis of Correlation Changes
##### Before Removing Outliers
Strong Correlations: Some variables such as 'sqft_living', 'sqft_above', 'bedrooms', and 'bathrooms' showed strong correlations with 'price', indicating that larger and more accommodating properties tend to have higher prices.
Moderate to Weak Correlations: Variables like 'sqft_lot', 'floors', and 'yr_built' displayed weaker correlations with 'price', suggesting these features have less influence on property pricing or are more variable.
##### After Removing Outliers
General Trends: The correlations generally became slightly weaker, particularly for variables directly associated with property size. This can be attributed to the reduction in extreme price values distorting these relationships.
Reduced Impact of Extreme Cases: The relationship between 'price' and 'sqft_above' or 'sqft_living' lessened slightly, indicating a more normalized and uniform dataset where property size is less variably linked to extreme pricing.

Also something interesting to look at is the the values of waterfront 


This analysis underscores the importance of tailored data cleaning strategies based on the specific requirements and conditions of the dataset to optimize both the quality and usefulness of the data for subsequent analyses.

#### Feature Engineering and Correlation Changes 

- House Age: Calculated as the difference between the current year and the year the house was built.
- Years Since Renovation: Represents the number of years since the house was last renovated, providing insight into the property's upkeep and modernity.
- Total Square Footage: Sum of the living area and lot size, offering a composite measure of space.
- Price Per Square Foot: A critical indicator of value, derived by dividing the house price by the living area square footage.
- Bed to Bath Ratio: Gives an idea of the layout efficiency, calculated by dividing the number of bedrooms by the number of bathrooms.

### Reason<a name="reason"></a>

Housing affordability is a crucial concept in today's economic landscape, impacting urban development, demographic trends, and socio-economic balance. The proposed Affordability Index aims to provide a comprehensive indicator summarizing housing affordability, aiding stakeholders in decision-making regarding housing policies or investments.

### Justification of the Problem<a name="justification-of-the-problem"></a>

Housing affordability is increasingly becoming a pressing issue globally, affecting life quality and the economic viability of cities and regions. Rising house prices relative to incomes have significant implications for social mobility and economic diversity. This project addresses this core aspect of living conditions by focusing on affordability, relevant to policymakers, real estate investors, and potential homebuyers or renters.

### Relevance of the Data<a name="relevance-of-the-data"></a>

The dataset includes essential variables such as house prices, income levels, and other key economic indicators, sourced from a reliable dataset (e.g., Kaggle). It provides detailed information necessary for analyzing housing affordability across different regions, ensuring that the resulting Affordability Index accurately reflects the housing market's realities.

### Sub-Indices Composition<a name="sub-indices-composition"></a>

The Affordability Index comprises several sub-indices, each representing a dimension of affordability:

- **Price to Income Ratio (PIR):** A traditional measure of housing affordability, indicating the relationship between median house prices and median household income. A lower PIR suggests more affordable housing.
- **Mortgage as a Percentage of Income:** Determines the proportion of a household's income required to pay for mortgages, indicating the sustainability of housing markets.
- **Cost of Living Adjustment:** Considers overall living costs, including taxes and utilities, to understand true housing affordability.

### Integration and Weights of the Sub-Indices<a name="integration-and-weights-of-the-sub-indices"></a>

Each sub-index is weighted based on its relative importance in determining overall affordability. For instance, the Price to Income Ratio may carry more weight due to its significance in affordability. The weighting scheme undergoes analysis and iterative testing to ensure comprehensive representation of affordability factors.

### Theoretical Support<a name="theoretical-support"></a>

The Affordability Index is supported by relevant economic theories, such as the law of supply and demand, which underscores the importance of the Price to Income Ratio in affordability assessment. Economic principles suggest that as housing becomes less affordable, demand should decrease.

### Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

The structured framework of the Affordability Index offers a systematic approach to measuring and understanding housing affordability. Leveraging economic indicators, the project aims to provide valuable insights into a widespread concern using methodologically sound approaches to index construction. Its composite nature allows for a multidimensional perspective necessary for capturing the complex reality of housing affordability.
